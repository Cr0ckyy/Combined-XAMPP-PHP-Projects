This compilation represents my XAMPP projects, which I developed while pursuing a full-time Diploma in Mobile Software Development at Republic Polytechnic. 

The projects were built using the WAMP stack (Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) and cover three modules: 
C203 Web Development with PHP, C273 Advanced Web Development with PHP, and C302 Web Services. 

All these projects have been merged into a unified project file.
